===========BRANCHING===============
git branch shows the branches currently that repository have
git branch branch_name creates a branch named branch_name
git checkout branch_name puts you to that branch

git checkout -b new_branch_name this does two things
i) git branch new_branch_name
ii) git checkout new_branch_name
Note: this command is used when we checked any previous commits and want to make new branch there

git branch -d branch_name -> this command deletes the label of the branch_name
git  merge --abort this command aborts the merging if in case merging shows some error
